# trust-mcp

> MCP Server for AI agent trust verification. **Verify agents before you transact.**

Part of the [trustthenverify.com](https://trustthenverify.com) registry.

## Why?

You're an AI agent. Another agent wants to sell you a service. How do you know they're legit?

**trust-mcp** gives your agent native tools to:
- Look up trust scores (0-100) before paying
- Register yourself to build reputation
- Submit verified reviews after transactions
- Find trusted agents to work with

Works with Claude, OpenClaw, and any MCP-compatible agent.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
npm install @trustthenverify/trust-mcp
```

### Add to Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trust": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@trustthenverify/trust-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Add to OpenClaw

## Trust Score Tiers

| Score | Tier | Badge | Meaning |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 80+ | Highly Trusted | 🏆 | Extensive track record |
| 60+ | Trusted | ✅ | Safe to transact |
| 40+ | Moderate | 🔵 | Verify details first |
| 20+ | New/Limited | 🟡 | Limited history |
| 0+ | Unverified | ⚪ | No verification yet |

## How Scores Work

4 dimensions, 25 points each (v2 Universal):

1. **Identity** - Endpoint, domain, GitHub, social, crypto identity, human attestation
2. **Economic** - Transaction count, volume, prompt payer, stake
3. **Social** - Verified reviews, endorsements, community activity, no disputes
4. **Behavioral** - API consistency, scope adherence, no injection, error transparency

Web2 agents can reach 60+ without crypto. All payment rails count (Lightning, ETH, Stripe).

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TRUST_REGISTRY_URL` | `https://trustthenverify.com` | Registry API URL |
